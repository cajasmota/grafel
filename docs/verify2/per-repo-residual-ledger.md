# Per-repo Residual Ledger (Tier-1)

_Seeded 2026-05-19 from wave-1 + wave-2 fix-agent reports and the
`quick-tier1-baseline-refresh-2026-05-19-v2.md` measurement set
(Closes #484, Refs #44)._

This ledger is the single source of truth for **what is still wrong, where, and why**
on every tier-1 repo in `scripts/verify2/run.sh`. It exists so wave-N planning is a
filter+sort against one file, not a re-read of every fix-agent thread.

## How to use this ledger

1. **After every merged fix PR:** the coordinator updates each affected row
   - new `Latest bug-rate` (date + source measurement doc)
   - new `Residual root cause` from the fix-agent's report
   - new `Status` per the enum below
   - `Blocker / next fix` = the next chain-fix PR or issue number to file
2. **After every re-measurement run:** update `Latest bug-rate` for all measured rows
   even if root cause is unchanged.
3. **Picking the next wave:** filter `Status in {at-bar, addressable}`, sort by
   bug-rate desc, take top 3-4. Avoid `structural` and `upstream` unless the
   blocking primitive issue is also in-flight.

## Workflow rule (going forward)

**Every wave's fix-agent PR body MUST include two lines:**

```
Residual root cause: <one sentence — what bug class still dominates the residual>
Status: <at-ship-gate | at-bar | addressable | structural | upstream>
```

The coordinator then updates this ledger as part of the merge step. PRs that
miss these lines should be sent back to the agent before merge.

## Status enum

| Status | Definition |
|---|---|
| `at-ship-gate` | bug-rate <= 1% (#44 target) |
| `at-bar` | 1% < bug-rate <= 8% (per-repo bar passed, ship-gate gap remains) |
| `addressable` | > 8% but next-layer chain-fix is queued (PR# or issue# in Blocker col) |
| `structural` | > 8%, fix requires multi-day work and a dedicated issue (in Blocker col) |
| `upstream` | > 8%, blocked on an extractor/resolver primitive being landed elsewhere |
| `unmeasured` | in `scripts/verify2/run.sh` tier-1 manifest but not yet indexed (not on disk) |

## Sources of truth

- Latest aggregate measurement: `docs/verify2/quick-tier1-baseline-refresh-2026-05-19-v3.md` (40 repos, post-determinism #486, includes #474-#483 chain-fixes — **reliable single-shot**)
- Prior aggregate: `docs/verify2/quick-tier1-baseline-refresh-2026-05-19-v2.md` (40 repos, post wave-1+2, pre #474-#483; noisy)
- Prior aggregate: `docs/verify2/quick-tier1-baseline-2026-05-19.md` (40 repos, baseline before any wave)
- Ship-gate v4: `docs/verify2/ship-gate-baseline-refresh-v4.md` (32-repo intersection, pre-quick-tier1)
- Wave-1+2 fix PRs: #466 #467 #468 #469 #470 #471 #472 #473
- Wave-3 chain-fix PRs (merged on `main` but not yet re-measured in v2 doc): #474 #475 #476 #477 #478 #480 #483

## Ledger

(Bug-rate dates: `v3` = 2026-05-19 quick-tier1 refresh v3 (post-determinism #486 — reliable single-shot).
`v2` = 2026-05-19 quick-tier1 refresh v2 (noisy, pre-determinism). `v4` = 2026-05-18 ship-gate v4.
PR# in the Latest column means "post-#NNN re-measurement reported in the PR thread," not yet
folded into an aggregate baseline doc.)

| vapor | swift | ~250 | 8.93% (2026-05-19, post-#499 swift extractor noise filter) — was 9.26% pre-fix | chain-fix #499 (swift extractor): (a) `extractImportPath` now skips `modifiers`/`attribute`/`attributes` subtrees — synthetic dotted import paths like `_documentation.visibility.internal.Foundation` no longer reach `classifyExternal`; the synth-side prefix-strip in `classifyExternal` is now redundant but kept as a belt-and-braces guard. (b) `extractCallRelationships` now filters Swift statement keywords (`defer`, `repeat`, `do`) and bare-receiver `init` from the CALLS emission path; `Type.init(...)` is preserved via the recvRoot != "" gate so explicit initializer calls keep their receiver_type property. Measured delta: bug-extractor 379 → 359 (-20); bug-resolver 85 → 85 (flat); resolved 3070 → 3089 (+19); total bugs 464 → 444 (-20); net bug-rate -0.33pp. Regression check on chi/express/flask/spdlog/vapor-api-template: 0.00pp on all five (perfect non-swift control). Earlier wave-4 swift external-known refresh: (a) extend `knownExternalPackages` with the SwiftNIO sister modules (`NIOPosix`, `NIOConcurrencyHelpers`, `NIOSSL`, `NIOExtras`, `NIOWebSocket`, `NIOTransportServices`, `NIOEmbedded`, `NIOHTTPCompression`, `_NIOFileSystem`, `_NIOFileSystemFoundationCompat`, `CNIOLinux`/`Darwin`/`Posix`/`Atomics`), Apple SSWG packages (`_CryptoExtras`, `AsyncKit`, `AsyncHTTPClient`, `ServiceLifecycle`, `Metrics`, `Atomics`, `Algorithms`, `SystemPackage`, `ArgumentParser`, `ServiceContextModule`, `SwiftASN1`), Vapor sister kits (`RoutingKit`, `ConsoleKit{,Terminal,Commands}`, `MultipartKit`, `WebSocketKit`, `CVaporBcrypt`), and platform shims (`Glibc`, `Musl`, `Android`, `Darwin`, `Dispatch`, `WinSDK`, `X509`); (b) swift-gated attribute-prefix strip in `classifyExternal` for `@_documentation(visibility:...)` / `@_exported` / `@preconcurrency` / `@_implementationOnly` / `@testable` import shapes; (c) extend `swiftBareNames` with NIO Channel API verbs (`fireChannelRead`, `wrapOutboundOut`, `unwrapInboundIn`, `writeAndFlush`, `addHandler`, `runIfActive`, `flatMapErrorThrowing`, `moveReaderIndex`, etc.) + Foundation Codable container types (`UnkeyedContainer`, `SingleValueContainer`) + NIO HTTP codec types. bug-extractor 627 → 379 (-248); bug-resolver 88 → 85 (-3); external-known 291 → 431 (+140); external-unknown 527 → 638 (+111). Net -252 bugs / -5.01pp. Generic verbs (`defer`, `init`, `storage`, `contains`, `read`, `write`, `succeed`, `fail`, `validate`, `serialize`, `closure`, `cache`, `sessions`, etc.) deliberately OMITTED per safer-bias (#94/#105/#106) — they collide with user methods. | addressable | #499 landed (extractor noise filter). Residual 8.93% above ship-gate is structural and lives upstream: (a) #494 receiver-type tracking — local variable type inference (`let svc = MyService(); svc.foo()` cannot resolve `foo` because we only attach receiver_type for declared class fields); (b) bug-resolver floor (~85 edges): ambiguous locally-defined user methods like `validate`/`createSession`/`deleteSession` resolved against multiple same-named candidates — needs cross-file disambiguation pass; (c) remaining bug-extractor edges (~150) are mostly Foundation/NIO generic verbs (`flatMap`, `map`, `then`, etc.) that the safer-bias filter deliberately keeps off the external-known allowlist. |

## Status roll-up (v3 refresh 2026-05-19)

| Status | Count |
|---|---:|
| at-ship-gate | 4 |
| at-bar | 16 |
| addressable | 6 |
| structural | 13 |
| upstream | 1 |
| unmeasured | 75 |
| **total tier-1 repos** | **115** |

Notes:
- 4 ship-gate (argocd-example-apps, starter-workflows, prometheus-helm, openapi-stripe) — argocd + starter-workflows now folded into the aggregate baseline.
- 16 at-bar (was 10 at v2): added chi, gin, grpc-go-examples, ktor-samples, terraform-aws-vpc (chain-fixed and folded), play-scala-starter (promoted from addressable).
- 1 upstream (etcd): 0.62 pp from bar but waiting on receiver-variable-type-tracking primitive.
- exposed moved addressable -> addressable but BACK ABOVE bar (8.56 -> 11.00) — v2 number was a noisy underestimate; v3 single-shot trustworthy. Treat as not-yet-at-bar.

## Next-wave candidates (filter: status in {at-bar, addressable}, sorted by bug-rate desc, v3 numbers)

| Rank | Repo | Lang | Bug-rate | Why |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | nextjs-commerce | typescript | 17.14% | TS framework-level resolution (Next.js router + RSC) |
| 2 | nestjs-starter | typescript | 16.67% | post-#475 TS-on-Node residual still dominates |
| 3 | exposed | kotlin | 11.00% | Kotlin DSL receivers beyond Ktor Routing (v3 reveals v2 was noisy under-read) |
| 4 | kickstart.nvim | lua | 9.86% | lua regression vs v1 — investigate transitive cause |
| 5 | aspnetcore-realworld | csharp | 9.82% | next csharp wave (one-step from bar) |
| 6 | phoenix-todo-list | elixir | 9.38% | first elixir wave, very close to bar |
| 7 | spring-petclinic | java | 8.34% | first java wave — within striking distance of bar |
| 8 | etcd | go | 8.62% | upstream — receiver-variable-type primitive will unblock |

`structural` rows (rust, php, java, ruby, python, swift, zig, just, fish, clojure)
are higher-bug-rate but each requires a dedicated multi-day extractor wave —
prioritise via the JIRA backlog, not this ledger.
